    <h1> Muffins </h1> 
    <p> <img src="../media/muffins.jpg" alt="Muffins photo" height="310" width="310" </p>
    <p> Muffins are small cakes typically baked in individual molds, with a soft </p>
    <p> and airy texture. They can be sweet (with add-ins like blueberries, chocolate,  </p>
    <p> or nuts) or savory (for example, with cheese or vegetables). Muffin batter is quick to prepare — dry </p>
    <p> and wet ingredients are mixed separately, then combined and immediately distributed into </p>
    <p> molds. It's a simple and versatile recipe for homemade baking. </p>
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp baking powder </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp salt </li>
        <li> 1 cup (240 ml) milk </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup (80 ml) vegetable oil or melted butter </li>
        <li> 1 large egg </li>
        <li>  1 tsp vanilla extract (optional) </li>
    </ul>
<h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease it. </li>
            <li> Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl: flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. </li>
            <li> Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl: milk, oil (or butter), egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li> Add wet to dry ingredients. Stir gently with a spoon or spatula until just combined. Do not overmix—it's okay if a few lumps remain. </li>
            <li> Fold in add-ins (if using) carefully. </li>
            <li> Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 to 3/4 full. </li>
            <li> Bake for 18–22 minutes, or until the tops are lightly golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </li>
            <li>  Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. </li>
        </ol>
